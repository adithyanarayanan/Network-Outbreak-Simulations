This directory has three items. 

1. hasl_simulations.R - a parameter adjustable R Script which generates and performs the "Haslemere" network simulations used in this study.
2. countsdirectory - a default directory into which csv files generated from the simulation are stored. These files will be aggregated to produde visuals. Currently, the directory has sample output data generated from 3 outbreaks with primary tracing in place.
3. hasl_visuals.R - an R Script which produces a plot based on the data stored in the countsdirectory.

Note: The data generated and stored in countsdirectory can be altered infinitely using pa_simulations.R - please read the comments in the script to tune parameters to pick your tracing strategy of choice, outbreak duration, etc.
